# 📅 Day 7 – Basic DSA Practice

## 🎯 Focus of the Day

Practiced **basic array-based DSA problems** in Java to strengthen loop logic and array manipulation without using extra space or sorting.

---

## 🧩 Problems Solved

### 1️⃣ Count Even and Odd Numbers in an Array

**Problem:**
Given an integer array, count how many elements are even and how many are odd.

**Logic Used:**

* Traverse the array using a loop
* Use modulo operator (`% 2`)
* Maintain two counters: `even` and `odd`

**Key Concepts:**

* Array traversal
* Conditional statements
* Counter variables

---

### 2️⃣ Reverse an Array (Without Using Extra Array)

**Problem:**
Reverse the elements of an array in-place.

**Logic Used:**

* Use two pointers (`start` and `end`)
* Swap elements while `start < end`
* Move pointers towards the center

**Key Concepts:**

* Two-pointer technique
* Swapping elements
* While loop

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

* Arrays can be manipulated efficiently using loops
* No extra space is required for reversing an array
* Basic DSA problems improve logic and confidence

📌 *Day focused on clarity of logic rather than complexity.*
