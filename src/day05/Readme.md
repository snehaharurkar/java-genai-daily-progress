# Day 5 – Classes, Objects & Constructors

## What I learned today
- Understood what a Class is and why it is needed
- Learned how Objects are created from a class
- Studied Constructors and their role in initializing objects
- Difference between default constructor and parameterized constructor

## Programs practiced
- Created a Student class with variables and methods
- Used constructors to initialize student details
- Created objects and accessed class members

## Key takeaways
- Class is a blueprint, object is a real-world instance
- Constructor runs automatically when an object is created
- Constructors do not have a return type

## Next goal
- Practice methods with parameters and return types
- Start working with arrays inside classes
